Prompt and image attribute guide

To use Imagen on Vertex AI you must provide a text description of what you want to generate or edit. These descriptions are called prompts, and these prompts are the primary way you communicate with Generative AI on Vertex AI.

This guide shows you how modifying parts of a text-to-image prompt can produce different results and gives you examples of images you can create. This guide also provides guidance on how you can edit images using text prompts and iteration.

You can also report suspected abuse of Imagen on Vertex AI or any generated output that contains inappropriate material or inaccurate information using the Report suspected abuse on Google Cloud form.

Prompt writing basics (subject, context, and style)
While there's no one way to write good prompts, adding some keywords and modifiers will help you get closer to your end goal. Prompts don't need to be long or complex, but most good prompts are descriptive and clear.

A good starting point can be to think of subject, context, and style.

Prompt with subject, context, and style emphasized
Image text: A sketch (style) of a modern apartment building (subject) surrounded by skyscrapers (context and background).
Subject: The first thing to think about with any prompt is the subject: the object, person, animal, or scenery you want an image of.

Context and background: Just as important is the background or context in which the subject will be placed. Try placing your subject in a variety of backgrounds. For example, a studio with a white background, outdoors, or indoor environments.

Style: Finally, add the style of image you want. Styles can be general (painting, photograph, sketches) or very specific (pastel painting, charcoal drawing, isometric 3D).

After you write a first version of your prompt, refine your prompt by adding more details until you get to the image that you want. Iteration is important. Start by establishing your core idea, and then refine and expand upon that core idea until the generated image is close to your vision.

photorealistic sample image 1
Prompt: A park in the spring next to a lake
photorealistic sample image 2
Prompt: A park in the spring next to a lake, the sun sets across the lake, golden hour
photorealistic sample image 3
Prompt: A park in the spring next to a lake, the sun sets across the lake, golden hour, red wildflowers

Imagen 3 can transform your ideas into detailed images, whether your prompts are short or long and detailed. Refine your vision through iterative prompting, adding details until you achieve the perfect result.

Short prompts let you generate an image quickly.

Imagen 3 short prompt example
Prompt: close-up photo of a woman in her 20s, street photography, movie still, muted orange warm tones
Longer prompts let you add specific details and build your image.

Imagen 3 long prompt example
Prompt: captivating photo of a woman in her 20s utilizing a street photography style. The image should look like a movie still with muted orange warm tones.
Additional advice for Imagen 3 prompt writing:

Use descriptive language: Employ detailed adjectives and adverbs to paint a clear picture for Imagen 3.
Provide context: If necessary, include background information to aid the AI's understanding.
Reference specific artists or styles: If you have a particular aesthetic in mind, referencing specific artists or art movements can be helpful.
Use prompt engineering tools: Consider exploring prompt engineering tools or resources to help you refine your prompts and achieve optimal results.
Enhancing the facial details in your personal and group images:
Specify facial details as a focus of the photo (for example, use the word "portrait" in the prompt).
Consider using a larger model like Imagen 3 instead of Imagen 3 Fast to improve detail.
Generate text in images
Imagen 3's ability to add text into your images opens up creative image generation possibilities. Use the following guidance to get the most out of this feature:

Iterate with confidence: You might have to regenerate images until you achieve the look you want. Imagen's text integration is still evolving, and sometimes multiple attempts yield the best results.
Keep it short: Limit text to 25 characters or less for optimal generation.
Multiple phrases: Experiment with two or three distinct phrases to provide additional information. Avoid exceeding three phrases for cleaner compositions.

Imagen 3 generate text example
Prompt: A poster with the text "Summerland" in bold font as a title, underneath this text is the slogan "Summer never felt so good"
Guide Placement: While Imagen can attempt to position text as directed, you should expect occasional variations. This feature is continually improving.

Inspire font style: Specify a general font style to subtly influence Imagen's choices. Don't rely on precise font replication, but expect creative interpretations.

Font size: Specify a font size or a general indication of size (for example, small, medium, large) to influence the font size generation.

Prompt parameterization
To better control output results, you might find it helpful to parameterize the inputs into Imagen when working with the Imagen API or Vertex AI SDK for Python. For example, suppose you want your customers to be able to generate logos for their business, and you want to make sure logos are always generated on a solid color background. You also want to limit the options that the client can select from a menu.

In this example, you can create a parameterized prompt similar to the following:

A {logo_style} logo for a {company_area} company on a solid color background. Include the text {company_name}.
In your custom user interface, the customer can input the parameters using a menu, and their chosen value populates the prompt Imagen receives.

For example:

Prompt: A minimalist logo for a health care company on a solid color background. Include the text Journey.

Imagen 3 prompt parameterization example 1

Prompt: A modern logo for a software company on a solid color background. Include the text Silo.

Imagen 3 prompt parameterization example 2

Prompt: A traditional logo for a baking company on a solid color background. Include the text Seed.

Imagen 3 prompt parameterization example 3

Style: photography
Prompt includes: "A photo of..."
To use this style, start with using keywords that clearly tell Imagen on Vertex AI that you're looking for a photograph. Start your prompts with "A photo of. . .". For example:

photorealistic sample image 1
Prompt: A photo of coffee beans in a kitchen on a wooden surface
photorealistic sample image 2
Prompt: A photo of a chocolate bar on a kitchen counter
photorealistic sample image 3
Prompt: A photo of a modern building with water in the background
Image source: Each image was generated using its corresponding text prompt with the Imagen 3 model.

Style: illustration and art
Prompt includes: "A painting of...", "A sketch of..."
Art styles vary from monochrome styles like pencil sketches, to hyper-realistic digital art. For example, the following images use the same prompt with different styles:

"An [art style or creation technique] of an angular sporty electric sedan with skyscrapers in the background"

art sample images
Prompt: A technical pencil drawing of an angular...
art sample images
Prompt: A charcoal drawing of an angular...
art sample images
Prompt: A color pencil drawing of an angular...
art sample images
Prompt: A pastel painting of an angular...
art sample images
Prompt: A digital art of an angular...

Image source: Each image was generated using its corresponding text prompt with the Imagen 3 model.

Shapes and materials
Prompt includes: "...made of...", "...in the shape of..."
One of the strengths of this technology is that you can create imagery that is otherwise difficult or impossible. For example, you can recreate your company logo in different materials and textures.

shapes and materials example image 1
Prompt: a duffle bag made of cheese
shapes and materials example image 2
Prompt: neon tubes in the shape of a bird
shapes and materials example image 3
Prompt: an armchair made of paper, studio photo, origami style
Image source: Each image was generated using its corresponding text prompt with the Imagen 3 model.

Historical art references
Prompt includes: "...in the style of..."
Certain styles have become iconic over the years. The following are some ideas of historical painting or art styles that you can try.

"generate an image in the style of [art period or movement]: a wind farm"

impressionism example image
Prompt: generate an image in the style of an impressionist painting: a wind farm
renaissance example image
Prompt: generate an image in the style of a renaissance painting: a wind farm
pop art example image
Prompt: generate an image in the style of pop art: a wind farm
Image source: Each image was generated using its corresponding text prompt with the Imagen 3 model.

Image quality modifiers
Certain keywords can let the model know that you're looking for a high-quality asset. Examples of quality modifiers include the following:

General Modifiers - high-quality, beautiful, stylized
Photos - 4K, HDR, Studio Photo
Art, Illustration - by a professional, detailed
The following are a few examples of prompts without quality modifiers and the same prompt with quality modifiers.

corn example image without modifiers
Prompt (no quality modifiers): a photo of a corn stalk
corn example image with modifiers
Prompt (with quality modifiers): 4k HDR beautiful
photo of a corn stalk taken by a
professional photographer
Image source: Each image was generated using its corresponding text prompt with the Imagen 3 model.

Aspect ratios
Imagen 3 image generation lets you set five distinct image aspect ratios.

Square (1:1, default) - A standard square photo. Common uses for this aspect ratio include social media posts.
Fullscreen (4:3) - This aspect ratio is commonly used in media or film. It is also the dimensions of most old (non-widescreen) TVs and medium format cameras. It captures more of the scene horizontally (compared to 1:1), making it a preferred aspect ratio for photography.

aspect ratio example
Prompt: close up of a musician's fingers playing the piano, black and white film, vintage (4:3 aspect ratio)
aspect ratio example
Prompt: A professional studio photo of french fries for a high end restaurant, in the style of a food magazine (4:3 aspect ratio)
Portrait full screen (3:4) - This is the fullscreen aspect ratio rotated 90 degrees. This lets to capture more of the scene vertically compared to the 1:1 aspect ratio.

aspect ratio example
Prompt: a woman hiking, close of her boots reflected in a puddle, large mountains in the background, in the style of an advertisement, dramatic angles (3:4 aspect ratio)
aspect ratio example
Prompt: aerial shot of a river flowing up a mystical valley (3:4 aspect ratio)
Widescreen (16:9) - This ratio has replaced 4:3 and is now the most common aspect ratio for TVs, monitors, and mobile phone screens (landscape). Use this aspect ratio when you want to capture more of the background (for example, scenic landscapes).

aspect ratio example
Prompt: a man wearing all white clothing sitting on the beach, close up, golden hour lighting (16:9 aspect ratio)
Portrait (9:16) - This ratio is widescreen but rotated. This a relatively new aspect ratio that has been popularized by short form video apps (for example, YouTube shorts). Use this for tall objects with strong vertical orientations such as buildings, trees, waterfalls, or other similar objects.

aspect ratio example
Prompt: a digital render of a massive skyscraper, modern, grand, epic with a beautiful sunset in the background (9:16 aspect ratio)
Negative prompts
The previous examples focus on writing prompts for what you want Imagen to create, but you can also provide a negative prompt along with the original prompt to help the product generate or edit images. These negative prompts can be a powerful tool that helps specify what elements to omit from the image. Simply describe what you don't want.

Recommended — Plainly describe what you don't want to see. For example "wall, frame".

Not recommended — Avoid instructive language or words like "no" or "don't". For example, avoid phrases like "no walls" or "don't show walls".
